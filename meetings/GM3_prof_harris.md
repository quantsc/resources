# Prof Harris Takeaways

### (1) the benefit of Interactive Brokers is that it is a very realistic simulation machine

- In real trading, there is a certain risk involved in every trade made — i.e. people watch trades being made and then react to those trades; there is slippage and you need to make sure your actual trade is created

### (2) Larry Harris teaches trading and exchanges

- books: (free) Electronic Trading, what practitioners need to know, Trading and Exchanges
- Former chief economist at the SEC, director of a few mutual funds
- Wrote some of the CFA exam questions and leads study sessions

### (3) if you’re doing a high-frequency idea, you need to move quickly in response to signals that don’t last long but show up over and over and over again

- You play a game of probabilities — you want to exploit an edge on a regular basis, winning a certain margin of the time
  - There are only so many signals out there, and you have to analyze those signals well and respond quickly — everyone is looking at the same signals
- Lower frequency things truly don’t need to be computerized

### (4) needs for speed

- taking: if you see a profitable trade, get there before other people
- if you want to make market, be first in line: if the conditions are right to offer liquidity (make a limit order and wait for someone to make you an offer)
  - Offering a trade is ‘making market’ and other people will probably do that too
  - If you want to trade, you probably do want to trade
- if you see a signal that says you shouldn’t offer liquidity, you want to cancel your order quickly/when you want to — if you’re making market, you may decide you no longer want to — you may notice the broad index is dropping, and you may execute w/ the stock dropping too
  - If you don’t cancel fast enough, other people will sell to you at an undesirably high price

### (5) fast == getting data quickly from the exchange (some people read ticker tapes using AI from headlines and then translate it into a pattern and submit orders)

- responding quickly
- being received quickly

### (6) high frequency traders put computers near exchanges because it means you’re going a few microseconds faster (per router)

- HF traders complain about ethernet cable lengths from their servers to the exchange’s servers
- The speed of light is finite
- Your computer does 10 cycles per meter that light travels

### (7) note: we won’t be competitive (but Interactive Brokers can let you run code and that could be competitive)

- HFT are not supervised by broker dealers though so even IB is not a complete solution

### (8) you can lose nothing by doing nothing

### (9) consider ideas that are a little bit slower or ideas where you generate ideas others haven’t thought about

### (10) orthogonality is important: doing something/acting on a signal others don’t have

- You compete for liquidity when you trade on the same signals
- If you trade when others aren’t trading, you have an advantage

### (11) ideas:

- Construct a portfolio of 5-10 stocks replicating the HF returns of an interest rates or gas futures contract (some very liquid contract)
  - Gas producers, energy stocks, chemical stocks would be correlated
  - Get a sense of what happens when your futures contract moves —> securities that’s less actively traded may move slower —> you can modulate your holdings in your portfolio
- Keep it simple! Because otherwise you’ll never know if something’s working or not
  - Also don’t be dumb
    - A few years ago the most correlated thing to the S&P 500 was the fluctuations of sheep production in Afghanistan
      - If you used that as a leading indicator,,, that’d be foolish
    - Come up with 50 ideas out of hundreds or millions —> see which works
    - With a confidence level of 5%, 2.5 are going to look good even if they’re bad
  - Ideas can be complex:
    - Ex: how much gas do trucks buy, what routes are they on, how much wind or incline is there

### (12) technical trading from Harris’s perspective

- We need language to convey knowledge
- Technical trading has an extraordinarily rich language to describe all situations, and there is an assumption there is valuable information because there is a language
- That said, just because there’s a language doesn’t mean there’s information
- Brokers like it because it keeps people trading
- Momentum’s a great thing if you buy at the beginning, but at the beginning there’s no momentum. Momentum’s good if you buy at the middle, but the middle could be the end

### (13) 3 things distinguish a currency (bitcoin is not a currency)

- it’s used for buying
- it’s a denominator of prices
- it stores wealth
- bitcoin’s value comes from the amount of bitcoins being finite & fixed

### (14) his birthday is in September

- He wants tomorrow’s WSJ in time to trade today

### (15) researches trading rules/market structure

- There are lots of hidden pipelines of revenue
  - Ex: Robinhood sending orders to de shaw/citadel
  - Inverted exchanges (Ice owns the NYSE)
    - Minimum tick (penny at each exchange) should be the penny for the national market system, but inverted exchanges & regular exchanges make it half a penny because they’re separated from each other
      - HFT take advantage of this, but brokers don’t

### (16) the markets are at the center of capitalism. A transaction task would greatly decrease liquidity

- Gensler may favor it (potential SEC chairman); he’s a bit of a wild card

### (17) life lessons

- We live in a world that’s all data
- If you make a lot of money from an algo, chances are that it’s because you were lucky
- The time you spent obsessing about something is time you could’ve spent doing something else
- Making money pays the bills, but it can’t buy happiness
