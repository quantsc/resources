# Fundamental Finance and Valuation Concepts

### Valuation

*   Ratios / Multiples:
    *   Value of an asset is compared to some firm-specific variable, and the resulting ratio is compared across firms to determine relative desirability across those companies
    *   It is assumed that a specific multiple/ratio is relevant to multiple companies across an industry
    *   Examples:
        *   Price/Book Value (P/B Ratio)
        *   Earnings per Share (EPS)
        *   Price/Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)
        *   Price/Earnings/Growth (PEG Ratio)
        *   Price/Sales Revenue (P/S Ratio)
        *   Dividend Yield
*   Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
    *   Estimating the value of an investment based on expected future cash flow
*   Enterprise Value (EV)
    *   Measure of a company’s total value
    *   market capitalization + total debt [short and long term] - cash on a company’s balance sheet
    *   Note: market capitalization = number of outstanding shares * current stock price
    *   Note: often used for calculating a takeover price
*   EBITDA: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
    *   Proxy for cash flow in a given time period

### Asset Classes

*   Index funds are often invested in through mutual funds -- pooled investment vehicles managed by professionals.
*   Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are bundles of securities that are more easily traded than index funds/mutual funds. They can be bought or sold at any time.
*   Other: stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities

### Arbitrage 

- purchasing and selling a single asset based on its differing prices in different markets or forms

### Modern Portfolio Theory

*   MPT is how risk-averse investors construct portfolios to maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk _or_ achieve a certain expected return while minimizing possible risk
*   Expected return = weighted sum of individual assets’ returns, where weights are based on investment in each asset
*   Portfolio risk is a function of each asset’s variance and the correlations of each pair of assets

### Capital Asset Pricing Model

*   Cap-M describes the relationship between systematic risk and the expected return of assets
*   Risk-free rate accounts for the ‘time-value’ of money


*   The market risk premium is the return expected from the market above the risk-free rate

### Diversification

*   A diversified portfolio contains a mix of asset types to limit exposure to any single risk
    *   Positive performance of some investments neutralizes the negative performance of others
    *   Lower correlation between securities suggests they’ll respond differently to market influences
*   Ideally, diversification yields higher returns and lower risk than any individual holding

### Trading volume 

- Number of shares of a security that were traded in a given time

### Efficient frontier

*   The efficient frontier is the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk
    *   Risk is represented by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s return
*   All possible portfolios define a region in a space with axes risk & expected return
    *   The efficient frontier in this graph is a positively-sloped boundary to this region

### Sharpe & Sortino Ratios

*   Sharpe: return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk


*   Sortino: a variation of the Sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from total volatility

    *   By only focusing on the negative deviation of the portfolio’s returns (i.e the std. dev. of the downside), it gives a better view of a portfolio’s risk-adjusted performance, since positive volatility benefits the investor

### Greek Letters

*   Beta
    *   If a stock, i, is riskier than the market, β<sub>i</sub> > market
    *   If a stock, i, has β<sub>i</sub> &lt; market, it is less risky than the market
    *   A beta of 1 indicates a portfolio moves with the market; a beta of -1 indicates a portfolio moves in the opposite direction
    *   Ex: if someone’s portfolio has a beta of +4, it is 400% more volatile than the market; purchasing the same amount of stocks with a beta of -4 would make the portfolio beta neutral
*   Alpha describes returns
    *   Used to describe a strategy’s ability to beat the market; also referred to as excess return
    *   A basic calculation would be the difference between total return of an investment and a comparable benchmark in its asset category
*   Delta
    *   Compares the change in price of an asset with the change in the price of a derivative. It thus measures the degree to which an option is exposed to shifts in the price of the underlying asset
*   Gamma
    *   The rate of change in an option’s delta per 1-point move
*   Theta
    *   The rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time
*   Vega
    *   The measurement of an option’s price sensitivity to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset
*   Rho
    *   The rate at which the price of a derivative changes relative to a change in the risk-free rate of interest

### Slippage

*   Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed
*   It occurs to larger extents during periods of high volatility when market orders are used or when a large order is executed but there isn’t enough volume to maintain the bid/ask spread

### Liquidity 

- The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price

### Efficient market hypothesis

*   Says that share prices reflect all information, meaning it’s impossible to purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices
*   A low percentage of active managers outperform passive counterparts, which gives this hypothesis (or some variation of it) some credibility

### Herd behavior (as it applies to the markets)

*   As its name implies, herd behavior is when people mimic others’ decisions instead of making independent decisions based on their own information
*   It is discussed in relation to collective irrationalities and stock market bubbles
*   It is sometimes referred to as an information cascade
*   Fear and uncertainty generally increase herd behavior
