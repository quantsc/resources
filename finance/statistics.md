### P-values

*   Given a set of data and a specific model that you think it conforms to, a p-value is the probability that you would have gotten data more extreme
*   P-values are used for hypothesis testing to say whether certain results can indicate hypotheses can be rejected/accepted

### Hypothesis testing

*   Hypothesis testing is composed of base (null) and alternative hypotheses and some method to determine whether to accept/reject the base hypothesis

### Confidence intervals

*   Confidence intervals are ranges that you can say a value falls between with some level of confidence

### Important Distributions

*   Normal - used to na√Øvely describe stock movements
*   Log-Normal - an entirely positive distribution used to describe stock prices, since stock prices cannot be negative
*   Student t - used in place of the normal distribution if little data is available

### Correlation

*   Measures the degree to which two securities move in relation to one another
